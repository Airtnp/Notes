## Exception
* [CPU-Int-Table](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions)
* trap (int 3 / OxCC): ++EIP
> Traps are reported immediately after the execution of the trapping instruction. A trap is an exception that is reported immediately following the execution of the trapping instruction. Traps allow execution of a program or task to be continued without loss of program continuity. The return address for the trap handler points to the instruction to be executed after the trapping instruction.
* + [Windows-consider-INT3-single-byte-and-decrement-EIP-by-1](http://www.triplefault.io/2017/08/detecting-debuggers-by-abusing-bad.html)
* fault: EIP sames
> These can be corrected and the program may continue as if nothing happened. A fault is an exception that can generally be corrected and that, once corrected, allows the program to be restarted with no loss of continuity. When a fault is reported, the processor restores the machine state to the state prior to the beginning of execution of the faulting instruction. The return address (saved contents of the CS and EIP registers) for the fault handler points to the faulting instruction, rather than to the instruction following the faulting instruction.
* abort
> Some severe unrecoverable error.
* interrupt (programmable, syscall 0x80)
> Interrupts occur at random times during the execution of a program, in response to signals from hardware. System hardware uses interrupts to handle events external to the processor, such as requests to service peripheral devices. Software can also generate interrupts by executing the INT n instruction.

```c++
boolean want[2] = {false, false};
int turn = 0;

want[i] = true;
turn = j;
while (want[j] && turn == j)
    continue;
...critical section...
want[i] = false;

Assume contrary: two threads in critical section
Both in c.s. implies want[i] == want[j] == true
Thus both while loops exited because “turn != j”
Cannot have (turn == 0 && turn == 1)
     So one exited frst
w.l.o.g., T0 exited frst because “turn ==1” failed
     So turn==0 before turn==1
     So T1 had to set turn==0 before T0 set turn==1
     So T0 could not see turn==0, could not exit loop frst!

Consult saved settings for selected order
- “A: C: G:” (maybe PXE)
Load the first sector from a boot device
- Could be a floppy, hard disk, CDROM
- Without a BIOS, we’d be in a bit of a jam If the last two bytes are AA55, we’re set
Otherwise look somewhere else
- If no luck, strike terror into user's heart:
- “No Operating System Present
```
* + Boot-Sector Launch
```
Boot sector is copied to 0x7C00
Execution is transferred to 0x7C00
Extra step for hard disk or CD-ROM
    • Boot sector (“MBR”) knows about partitions
        • BIOS starts it running at 0x7C00, of course
        • Copies itself elsewhere in memory, jumps there
        • Loads “active” partition's boot sector at 0x7C00
Now we’re executing the boot loader – the first “software” to execute on the PC

No moving parts means no “seek time” / “rotational delay”
Read is faster than write
Write and “erase” are different
     A blank page can be written to (once)
     A written page must be erased before rewriting
     But pages can't be individually erased!
         “Erase” works on multi-page blocks (16 KB)
         “Erase” is very slow
         “Erase” damages the block each time

SSD vs. disk
☺ SSD's implement “regular disk” model
    LBA sectors
    Write-sector, read-sector, “park heads”, etc.
☺ Read operations are extremely fast (100X faster), no “seek
time” or “rotational delay” (every sector is “nearby”)
? Write operations “vary widely” (maybe 100X faster, maybe
not faster at all)
☺ SSD's use less power than actual disks (~1/5?)
☺ SSD's are shock-resistant
☹ Writing to an SSD wears it out much faster than a disk
☹ SSD's are expensive (20X or more)

PUSHF                       # %EFLAGS onto stack
ANDL $0x003FFDFF, (%ESP)    # Clear IF on stack
POPF                        # %EFLAGS from stack
; supervisor: interrupt
; user: should trap to VMM
; x86: ignore changes to privileged bits when POPF runs in user mode. does nothing, no trap
```
```
The effect of POPF/POPFD on the EFLAGS register changes, depending on the mode of operation. See Table 4-15 and the key below for details.

When operating in protected, compatibility, or 64-bit mode at privilege level 0 (or in real-address mode, the equivalent to privilege level 0), all non-reserved flags in the EFLAGS register except RF1, VIP, VIF, and VM may be modified. VIP, VIF and VM remain unaffected.

> RF is always zero after the execution of POPF. This is because POPF, like all instructions, clears RF as it begins to execute.

When operating in protected, compatibility, or 64-bit mode with a privilege level greater than 0, but less than or equal to IOPL, all flags can be modified except the IOPL field and RF, IF, VIP, VIF, and VM; these remain unaffected. The AC and ID flags can only be modified if the operand-size attribute is 32. The interrupt flag (IF) is altered only when executing at a level at least as privileged as the IOPL. If a POPF/POPFD instruction is executed with insufficient privilege, an exception does not occur but privileged bits do not change.

When operating in virtual-8086 mode (EFLAGS.VM = 1) without the virtual-8086 mode extensions (CR4.VME = 0), the POPF/POPFD instructions can be used only if IOPL = 3; otherwise, a general-protection exception (#GP) occurs. If the virtual-8086 mode extensions are enabled (CR4.VME = 1), POPF (but not POPFD) can be executed in virtual-8086 mode with IOPL < 3.

* memory virtualization
* + shadow page table
* + - store to %cr3
* + - - compile guest-kernel page table to real page table (map guest frame number to actual frame number)
* + - - set %cr3 to point to real page table
* + - fetch from %cr3
* + - - return the guest-kernel "physical" address of the virtual page table in guest-kernel virtual memory, not the physical address of the actual page table in physical memory
* + - access to guest-kernel page table
* + - - examine fake page table
* + - - store to fake PTE => re-compile (read-only virtual page table)
