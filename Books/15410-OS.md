## Exception
* [CPU-Int-Table](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions)
* trap (int 3 / OxCC): ++EIP
> Traps are reported immediately after the execution of the trapping instruction. A trap is an exception that is reported immediately following the execution of the trapping instruction. Traps allow execution of a program or task to be continued without loss of program continuity. The return address for the trap handler points to the instruction to be executed after the trapping instruction.
* + [Windows-consider-INT3-single-byte-and-decrement-EIP-by-1](http://www.triplefault.io/2017/08/detecting-debuggers-by-abusing-bad.html)
* fault: EIP sames
> These can be corrected and the program may continue as if nothing happened. A fault is an exception that can generally be corrected and that, once corrected, allows the program to be restarted with no loss of continuity. When a fault is reported, the processor restores the machine state to the state prior to the beginning of execution of the faulting instruction. The return address (saved contents of the CS and EIP registers) for the fault handler points to the faulting instruction, rather than to the instruction following the faulting instruction.
* abort
> Some severe unrecoverable error.
* interrupt (programmable, syscall 0x80)
> Interrupts occur at random times during the execution of a program, in response to signals from hardware. System hardware uses interrupts to handle events external to the processor, such as requests to service peripheral devices. Software can also generate interrupts by executing the INT n instruction.

## Process
* birth
* + execve(path, argv[], envp[])
* + - transfer argv/envp to top of new stack
* + - make stack frame for crt startup
* + - set registers (bp,sp / cs,ip)
* + spawn()
* + rfork() / clone()
* work
* + running/blocked (IO/sleep)/Runnable/Forking/Zombie
* death
* + exit(int)
* + kill(pid, sig)
* cleanup
* + close files
* + release memory
* special
* + orphan process: an orphan process is a computer process whose parent process has finished or terminated, though it remains running itself. (ppid -> 1)
* + zombie process: a zombie process or defunct process is a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.
* + daemon process: a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

## Thread
* user-space (N:1)
* + just swaps registers
* + maybe blocked by systemcall
* + cooperating with scheduler is hard
* + multiprocessor, how?
* kernel threads (1:1)
* + kernel managed register set
* + multiprocessor can utilitze
* + CPU-hog threads
* + user-space libraries must be rewritten to be thread-safe
* + require more kernel memory
* + - 1 PCB => 1 TCB + N TCB
* + - 1 k-stack => N k-stacks
* many-to-many (M:N)
* + user-thread | kernel threads (CPU)
* thread cancellation
* + asynchronous (immediate)
* + - free stack/registers, stop execution now, hard for GC
* + deferred
* + - register cancellation point, safe

## Synchronization
* atomic instruction sequence
* voluntary de-scheduling
* Mutually Exclusive
* + peterson's solution
```c++
boolean want[2] = {false, false};
int turn = 0;

want[i] = true;
turn = j;
while (want[j] && turn == j)
    continue;
...critical section...
want[i] = false;

Assume contrary: two threads in critical section
Both in c.s. implies want[i] == want[j] == true
Thus both while loops exited because “turn != j”
Cannot have (turn == 0 && turn == 1)
     So one exited frst
w.l.o.g., T0 exited frst because “turn ==1” failed
     So turn==0 before turn==1
     So T1 had to set turn==0 before T0 set turn==1
     So T0 could not see turn==0, could not exit loop frst!
```
* + Bakery algorithm (lamport) N-process
```
Phase 1 – Pick a number
     Look at all presently-available numbers
     Add 1 to highest you can find
Phase 2 – Wait until you hold lowest number
     Not strictly true: processes may have same number
     Use process-id as a tie-breaker
     (ticket 7, process 99) > (ticket 7, process 45)
     Your turn when you hold lowest (t,pid)

choosing[i] = true;
number[i] = max(number[0], number[1], ...) + 1;
choosing[i] = false;
for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
    while (choosing[j])
        continue;
    while ((number[j] != 0) &&
        ((number[i], i) > (number[j], j)))
        continue;
}
...critical section...
number[i] = 0;
```
* mutex
```c++
// Initialization
int lock_available = 0;
// “Try-lock”
i_won = xchg(&lock_available, 1);
// Spin-wait
while (xchg(&lock_available, 1)
    continue;
// Unlock
xchg(&lock_available, 1); /*expect 0!!*/
